Export to PDF.. Hmmm lets think about this a bit. Does it stop you from planning, assigning, leads and lags, etc.?....No. It gives you the tools that you need to support effective project scheduling. Is it multi-platform?.... Yes.. it runs on Linux and any system that has a JRE, whereas MS Project doesn't. Does it save your work?....Yes... not only to its own format, but to an XML format that may be sucked into other analysis tools. Is a Project Schedule out of date 30 seconds after your print it? ... Absolutely.. printing a \"Gantt Wall\" is a waste of paper, Gantt Charts have NEVER printed well. Time could be better spent on the front end creating a web site dashboard that sucks in the XML file saved, and places it on the screen via a collaborative software. I have seen several projects where they actually invested in a really expensive printers to print the Gantt Chart. With the kind of project that can afford that, the size of the project will demand a bigger printer, and a bigger wall.. It never works, and is quickly outdated. Is it freely available and usable by multiple members of a project team? Absolutely, I once came across a Program Manager that had to license 1000 copies of MS Project for his project team at significant cost. He nearly cried when I told him about Open Proj. Is the source provided if one desires to modify it? ... Yes it is... it is an open source product. It belongs in SourceForge. It is stupid to think otherwise. Not everything is free that is based on Open Source, Alfresco Enterprise for instance. I refer you back to Richard Stallman... \"free as in freedom, not free beer\", learn what Open Source is. Is Open Proj injured in such a way that it is unusable? ... No, the PDF aspect is annoying, but it does not prevent one from using it as a tool that may manage a project. Information derived from scheduling tools like Open Proj should be reported via a different media. The Gantt Chart should never be used as that media because it doesn't port well, and never has. Printing the Gantt is not the way a report should be done, and those who think otherwise have no idea as to how the tool should be used. Have Scheduling Tools ever been an effective communications medium? No, they have not. Microsoft built Project Server to supplement MS Project to handle the communication piece. Scheduling tools are outstanding tools to find the answers to scheduling problems, but they have never been intended to be communication tools or support communication via their Gantt Charts. Does Open Proj effectively compete with other scheduling tools out there? Absolutely! I prefer it over MS Project. Does Serena offer additional Project Management Tools that work alongside OpenProj? They do. They have a Program and Portfolio application. Microsoft only provides MS Project, and does not scale to support Programs or Portfolios in the same way that Serena does it. Though this costs money, if you need it, it is quite likely you are making money, and there should be no reason not to pay Serena for helping you be more effective, just as if you are saving money by not buying MS Project licensing, you can spend a little money for the PDF support. Open the walllet... let the moths fly out... and pay Serena so they can justify the business case for making project management software. Does it import MS Project .mpp files and offer comparable functions to MS Project? Yes it does. In short, the PDF function is a nit, not a dealbreaker. I would give this software three thumbs up, but I only have two to offer. If you want a stack of paper that you will throw away in a day, pay Serena and get the function..but don't bitch about it.

I LOVE Ecmojo, but I was wondering if you could PLEASE HELP ME, and maybe you could do an update for me. I love online simulations. I am looking for a really really good ECMO simulator. I found one called Mse ecmo that actually incorperated waveforms instead of just numbers. I could adjust ventilator settings, sedate the patient, place him on VV/VA ECMO, AND INDUCE cardioplegia. Unfortunatly it costs, and I live with my parents. They do not want me spending $500.00 on something they do not think I need.

I LOVE the study of ECPR, and resting the heart. 2: Allow the viewing of waveforms such as ECG, Pleth, ABP, and Co2 if not also CVP, and PAP. 3: Give me the ability to adjust my own ventilator settings. 4: I would like the ability to monitor sedation and Paralysis with, BIS, and TOF.

Like to scribble on lots of papers to work out that dream?............Sweet Home 3D is one of the most easiest FREE software to implement your idea. Start with a floor plan, create your walls, place your furniture, fit your doors and windows, fit your lights, label the room - do all of this on a 2D plan view with a live 3D view port (can be part of the main window which will take up screen space, or use a pop up to use it like a small preview screen). Change your room dimensions easily with hold&drag a wall. Updating the floor plan is easier with the auto assist in showing the alignment. Create multiple floors without hindrance. So many free objects are available for download which adds meaning to your design - be it kitchen, bathroom, living room, kids room, outdoor, etc. Use a properties window of the selected item to modify for desired size, color, texture or placement..........Finally to see a nice picture of what you have created - use the photo or video option to create a computer aided virtual snap shot/guided tour with realistic lighting. As in most paid softwares that provide \"realistic view\" rendering, it takes a CPU with multi-cores to work out the scenes faster. Don't be surprised, for a well designed plan you worked out, it might take 30 mins for a photo or 35 hours for a video in high quality..........I'm currently having a laptop with an Intel Pentium Core2Duo processor, 3 GB Ram, OS: Win7 Home premium 64bit on which Sweet Home 3D runs without any issues. Every aspect of using the software is smooth without any errors. Its just the rendering photo-video feature which is an excellent visual tool added in this free software. Use an Intel i7 or AMD FX processor to get lesser rendering time. Xeon or Opteron for those who want to take this software seriously for the rendering in shortest possible time..........As of now there is no GPU support, so graphics card is not a factor in the rendering process. The normal 3D view port provided in the main window uses the graphics card for live rendering in a lower quality format which is meant to assist your visualization on the main 2D plan view.........For new object-deign concepts or textures, you might have to find someone who can create it and have it easily imported through the menu.

Or learn to make one through the provided editors.......Its possible you might be looking for a sloping wall, or a raised outdoor ground surrounding the site location or a sloping roof or a curved wall.

{"name": "radlab", "summary": "Radiation detection and measurement education is necessary for a wide variety of people working with radiation. The equipment and laboratory setup needed for delivering this education are expensive and difficult to assemble due to the large variety of the type of experiments that are desirable to cover. For a basic education one needs to have gamma, beta, alpha and neutron sources, at least one detector to detect each type of radiation and other supplemental instrumentation to perform experiments. Although the radiation exposure due to these radioactive sources in an education laboratory is low, shielding and a private secured place is needed. Nearly two hundred thousand dollars is needed to construct such a basic laboratory described as above.

On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.

Like many people, at least for those who carried on programming, I reached a ceiling with Logo and moved on to other languages. Lhogho is a version of Logo which could potentially change that. Being compiled, it is considerably faster than any other version of Logo I have used which is good news for anyone with a larger project in mind. Lhogho also has an exellent interface for external libraries. This opens up a whole world of code to the Lhogho programmer. Lhogho does not yet have all the features proposed on the Lhogho website but even in its present form, I have been able to write a number of small 2D games and some 3D demos which I would never have been able to do in any other version of Logo. To give you an idea, I have written Lhogho versions of some of the examples on the NeHe website (http:nehe.gamedev.net) for example, number 21 (grid crazy), number 30 (collison detection) and number 32 (alpha blending). In its present form, Lhogho is probably not the best place for an absolute beginner to start - FMSLogo is probably better - but for experienced Logo users or those familiar with other languages it is great. If you like the idea of the easy of use of Logo combined with the performance of a compiled language then please give Lhogho a try. My fear is that without more support, this excellent project is going to fade and disappear so please get involved.", "help-count": "0"}}}

When this directory is absent, a NullPointerException is thrown, the creator should check whether the directory exists and displays a more understandable error message when it doesn't. Secondly, most of the code is undocumented, almost all public methods have no Java documentation and some classes (including the \"Texture\" class) don't fully respect Java code conventions. It drastically reduces the interest of this project for pedagogical purposes but there are a few text files that explain how this project works. Thirdly, this game doesn't handle auto-repeat key events correctly. As a consequence, the walk sound doesn't work very well under GNU Linux.

Disabling depth test when drawing it would fix it. Fifthly, the frame rate is extremely low and the memory footprint is very high for such a rudimentary first person shooter. I only get about 5 frames per second in windowed mode (in a small window) with a dual core CPU bought in 2007 (Intel Core 2 duo). This is not very surprising as the creator uses software rendering which is only suitable to display extremely simple meshes in low resolution (even though it becomes less \"unusable\" as the speed of the CPU increases as time goes by). Sixthly, the customizability of the game is quite limited even with the editor as there is no way of importing a mesh stored into a file in an \"open\" or widely known format. \"the player can build and set everything at will\" is currently plain wrong. Finally, this project is a good example of the anti-pattern \"Not invented here\". The creator reinvents the wheel which could be very interesting if the source code was good for learning purposes or at least if it brought something algorithmically new but it's not the case. Software rendering in Java is already implemented in the open source web engine 3DzzD which goes further and is better documented than LinkinLand. \"the developer has the full knowledge and control of the game rendering\" is plain wrong as the source code isn't documented enough and using third party libraries isn't a crime. The time exclusively spent in programming an engine isn't spent in programming a game. If a developer wants to focus on programming a game, it should use some libraries as creating a full featured engine can take years of work for several programmers. d3caster is a similar project under GPL, it uses no library and I learned a lot by reading its source code. A Java programmer should learn how the class path and the Java library path work. Some tool kits would fix some limitations of this game. For example, NEWT (JOGL) indicates which event is an auto-repeat event unlike AWT. JOAL (Java binding for OpenAL/OpenAL-Soft) works better under GNU Linux with OpenJDK than the Java Sound API. JOGL is hugely faster than the software rendering implemented in LinkinLand, using it would drive this game a lot more playable especially in full screen mode in high resolution. I don't want to discourage the creator of this game but if he really wants other developers to use his project, he will have to drive it a lot more appealing and reusable as even d3caster was used in only one publicly known free software as far as I know. There is no shame in using the right tool(s) for the right job. Both Java3D and JOGL are open source, using them doesn't mean that the developer doesn't have the \"full knowledge\" of anything, they can't be compared to black boxes, proprietary technologies. I don't criticize the graphics as programming and computer graphics require distinct skills. I see that the creator of this game has worked on it since (at least) 2012, I wish him good luck.", "help-count": "0"}}}

[same as above]\" What happens is that the auto configure program \"ophcrack-launcher.sh\" that is run automatically or manually, found the table, but passed the full table path to ophcrack, instead of just the directory that the table is in. Here is the solution: Edit that file to fix (you need to know vi, I can't help you on that): vi /usr/bin/ophcrack-launcher.sh Find line at almost the end \"Starting ophcrack\", and in the next line change -t $table_inline to -t $(dirname $table_inline) then try ophcrack-launcher.sh again.

Like keeping annotations on commands and then adding them to handler. Its a nice way to allow others add more stuff to it... However, i found something not correct. The server passing its instance to all the telnet clinet threads which call the servers processCommand method for execution of the command is not correct. Firstly It creates a cyclic loop on the code. Like Server dependent on client and client dependent on the server. Secondly, there is no synchronization on the processCommand method and hence i am sure, it will kind of mess up things, when multiple clients try out stuff at the same time. I would have kept the processCommand code in the client classes, rather than in the server, or else provided some sort of synchronization. But, keep in the client class makes it more fruitful, i suppose. And again, i am really not sure, what is the purpose of the javaLogger in the whole project. I think, i will take references from your code and implement a new one. Adding commands through annotations is a very nice idea, as far as the easiness to extend the code is concerned. But, using reflections makes it again a little less performant. Thanks.", "help-count": "0"}}}

As far as all those people who give FreePlane a bad wrap and 1 star. My advice to you is get involved in the project or go spend some money on the non-opensource products that cost a fortune and see if your experience is any better. When you provide negative feedback to people who give up their own time for free, is not very motivating I'm sure.

Frankly, it qualifies as abusive. Due to the supposed potential of its features, I literally spent 6 hours trying to learn it using its outdated, incorrect, and often confusing Tutorial. I only made it half way through the Tutorial, and I still feel like I don't have a handle on even basic features due to the mess this App is in. The fun begins with Many Dead Links on the Freeplane Support web pages and continues straight into the Map they use for their Tutorial. Straight away, you're met by a Giant Dead Node labeled \"Functions Index\" that links to a file that can't be found anywhere in Freeplane's Documentation when you look for it separate from the link. Then, you're blessed with the absence of simple universally accepted logic for how the App works. For example, you can't Click and Drag to choose multiple items. Instead, it doesn't matter what Key you add to clicking and dragging -- the Command, Option, or Shift Key all result in the same action of moving the Map around the screen. Control+Click pulls up the Contextual Menu that Right Clicking does. What a frustrating waste of high value Key+Click Commands. Simple tasks like Deletion and Undo are so stupidly designed, they're still a mystery in many cases, even after my 6 hours of Tutorial-based learning. The word \"Delete\" doesn't even exist in their Key Word Searchable Help Topics. Nor is there a Menu Option anywhere for Delete. Instead, it's named, \"Remove Node\", and the Key Command doesn't work. Click on a Node to delete it and only the text is deleted. Try and Undo this and you have to click outside the Node before Undo works to restore the text. Click on the Node's handle to Delete, nothing happens. In fact, the only way to Delete a Node outside the Edit Menu is to use the Cut Command with Command+X -- very dangerous and problematic. Child Node Creation is Menu Dependent as well. Seriously?!!! What nonsense!!! The Properties Panel is also a complete Mess!! Options are no longer Named as Instructed, and the Logic is Confusing. All I wanted to figure out was how to create an evenly spaced list of Nodes with a Similar Style. No way of automatically spacing them out without being tied to very ugly and unusable side effects. The following are just a sampling of additional commands you are told to use that don't do as they say. Sadly, I didn't start the list when it first started happening, so know that there are plenty more to be found in the first half of the Tutorial alone! Moving a connected node in space - Double Clicking oval handle does NOT move node to its original place. Automatic Edge Color - Option does not exist in Properties Panel. Missing - How to evenly space out a Group of Nodes. Free Floating Node Creation - Control+Click (as in one Instruction) and Control+Double Click (as in another Instruction) do NOT create this type of Node. You either have to use the Edit Drop-Down Menu, or create your own Short-Cut Key (Thank God for that feature ability - a True Blessing in this mess!) Free Floating Node Child Creation - Menu dependent, at best. Keeping CTRL pressed while choosing Add Connector does not enable the addition of a Label to the Connector Line Scrolling and panning the map - You CANNOT pan the map with Ctrl+Shift+Curcor up/down/left/right. You CAN with a Mouse Wheel for up/down andr Shift+Mouse Wheel left right. Bottom Line... the Freeplane Community should be ashamed of itself. For something like this to exist is the entire Community's fault, not just one individual's. Freeplane is the type of project that gives Open Source a Bad name!!

You can edit your files (mindmaps) barely using the mouse which gives you a lot of speed and fluity in your work (hot keys are easy to use and to assign) 3.

I have two great Bible study programs but I keep all my notes in FP. It is a great tool for breaking apart passages and taking notes as child branches of the chunks. I can link related verses and notes and filter to easily find nodes I've styled \"question\" or \"important\" or etc. I can drill down (with filters) on a node to just see its parents and its children so I can concentrate better. So much more flexible than a word processing document(s). I have a map of Gospels studies that would be hundreds of pages in a word processing doc(s) - and completely impossible to find anything. (Of course, in a mindmap you have to express thoughts in keywords and short, abbreviated phrases vs. long, rambling, verbose paragraphs typical of word processing docs -- although each node can contain such paragraphs - but they go in the nodes NOTES which usually stay out of sight until needed.) I'm constantly finding new ways to make Bible study easier, more efficient, and more fulfilling. You can even use it for Bible arcing and bracketing. And it is great for scripture memorization.

I have had no problems running it on a Windows 10/PRO, 64-bit system with current Java, etc. After installation, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that my synth was listed among those that were supported. I was able to download patches, edit them on my desktop, group them into libraries or scenes in various ways, and bulk upload them. In general, all the things I was hoping to be able to do. The interface is very clean, allows for a reasonable amount of comments and descriptive details to identify your work, and generally works smoothly and with little to no learning curve.

The memories came flooding back of queuing to buy my cardboard box of a motherboard and chips with the promise of ROMs. I built the computer the next day and waited impatiently for the ROMs that would take six weeks to arrive. I was in heaven. I went from never touching more than a calculator to writing programs in basic, assembly and machine code. Practical Electronics was a great source of games such as the text based 3D Star Trek and I purchased a bunch of games on tape. I wrote my own but never had the nerve to actually sell them. I did design a memory expansion board with a friend but as we ordered the samples to be made loads appeared in the magazines and we gave up. From “Exchange and Mart” (forerunner to the Internet) I bought an American Teletype machine all driven internally by solenoids and wrote in assembler code a printer driver to set up each character and operate the various carriage and paper movements. I once typed out the text from a UK101 dungeons and dragons game and it took all day. I wrote a block-move program (no DMA chip then) to read and write to tape allowing space invaders to load in a couple of minutes and then upgraded the tape interface to a staggering 2400 baud with no errors on a Sony electronically controlled tape drive I bought in an auction for £12. I added colour and sound with construction kits and added the brilliant Watford Electronics ROM that gave proper error codes, on screen editing and a true 32 line display similar to a Commodore PET. Why do people think that Sinclair invented affordable domestic computing as a hobby in 1980? I changed my job to work in IT and over the next 34 years have gone from the UK101 to BBC model B, CP/M, MSDOS, QB45, Molecular n/Star, Novell, Windows and now back to the UK101. What we need is the Watford Electronic WeMon ROM image and a loads more games. I will see what I can find on eBay...
