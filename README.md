# crawl-SourceForge

This is a file for crawling projects on SourceForge.

for testing , i just crawled projects of java in linux 

here is the url https://sourceforge.net/directory/language:java/os:linux/

You can now crawl these information (for now):
        name
        summary
        user-ratings : average rating
                       number of stars(1 star  ... and 5 stars)
                       dimensional_ratings           
        Categories(may be none)
        License(may be none)
        user_reviews (may be none) :  for each user: user_name
                                      number of stars
                                      review
                                      number of people thinking it useful
